# Automated Machine Learning for Concrete Strength Prediction using Apache Spark MLlib

## Project Overview

This project aims to build an AutoML system from scratch to predict concrete compressive strength using PySpark's MLlib. We experiment with various regression algorithms and optimize hyperparameters to find the best-performing model.

## Technologies Used

- *Programming Language:* Python 3.9.7
- *Libraries and Frameworks:*
	- *PySpark:* Data processing and machine learning.
	- *Pandas:* Data manipulation.
	- *NumPy:* Numerical operations.
	- *Seaborn:* Data visualization.
	- *Matplotlib:* Data visualization.
- *Environment:* Jupyter Notebook


## Conclusion

The GBT (Gradient-Boosted Tree) model presented the best overall performance and will be used in production. The project successfully demonstrates the use of PySpark's MLlib for building an AutoML system to predict concrete compressive strength, leveraging various regression algorithms and hyperparameter optimization techniques.
